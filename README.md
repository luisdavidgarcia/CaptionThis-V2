**CaptionThis V2** is an advanced Python-based deep learning application that 
generates accurate and contextual captions for images. This is a complete revamp 
of the original CaptionThis project, rebuilt with modern architecture and 
improved capabilities.

## 🌟 Project Status

This is a complete rewrite of the original 
[CaptionThis project](https://github.com/Jkozmo10/CaptionThis), that I 
contributed to. The V2 version aims to improve upon the original with:
- Modern architecture and better code organization
- Enhanced model performance
- Improved user interface
- Better documentation and testing

## Overview

### Summary

CaptionThis V2 leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to generate 
human-like descriptions for any image. Built with Python and modern AI 
frameworks, it offers both command-line and API interfaces for maximum flexibility.

### Key Features
